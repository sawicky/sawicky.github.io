A student with stolen credentials or a malicious teacher will be able to upload code via Moodle in a number of ways in the goal of attacking the computer that runs the Moodle instance. This attack can provide full remote access to that machine, including the modification of any sensitive data, as well as the breach of the internal network, in which a number of other attacks can be done to compromise the entire school network. </p>
<p>The compromise of a school network can easily lead to identify theft, fraudulent modification of grades, access to the billing systems aswell as classified data between non students.</p>
<p>This report will identify a method of attack using a custom quiz question which provides initial access to the Moodle server. Enumeration methods will also be identified that allows the traversal of a non-priviledged user into full remote access via insecurities within the database data structures, as well as highlighting the effects of poor password concealment.</p>
<h3 id="Objective"><a href="#Objective" class="headerlink" title="Objective"></a>Objective</h3><p>The objective of this report is to highlight the journey of my technical development within Offensive Security, culminating at the 4 week mark in the total exploitation of a machine that is highly rated as a ‘real-life’ scenario.<br>The machine in question is ‘Teacher’ from HackTheBox.eu, which involves the exploitation of the Moodle e-Learning framework and privilege escalation due to poor security of passwords. Both of these scenarios, especially a poorly secured password are highly prevalant in the every day world, and this knowledge is beneficial for my professional development, as the experience gained here can easily be applied to the real world. This experience will be needed if I pursue my security career in order to identify the low-hanging fruit of threats such as passwords or vulnerable software, and provide solutions to help secure an environment.</p>
<p>I will also explore my methods of enumeration, which is the thought process and order of operations that I have built for myself that will help me in achieving the exploitation of a machine. As I practice on real world machines and vulnerable machines provided by a hobby website, my list of enumeration steps expands, and helps me in achieving an initial foothold in the exploitation. This step is incredibly important, as not only does enumeration grow vertically in number of items to iterate through, but through experience it also grows laterally - using the same steps in different methods, or paying closer attention to the simpler steps in order to find a foothold.</p>
<h3 id="Tools"><a href="#Tools" class="headerlink" title="Tools"></a>Tools</h3><p>To connect to the HackTheBox environment, we are given an OpenVPN package which we connect to, esentially installing a tunnel between our machine and their network. The machine that we decide to work on is given a single or a range of private IP addresses, which we can then access as we are inside that network.</p>
<h5 id="kali"><a href="#kali" class="headerlink" title="kali"></a>kali</h5><p>The bulk of work done in the exploitation of the machine is within the Kali Linux operating system. Kali is a flavour of Linux specially built for penetration testing and exploitation, and includes about 3000 different tools, scripts and frameworks already installed, a selection of which we will be using.</p>
<h5 id="nmap"><a href="#nmap" class="headerlink" title="nmap"></a>nmap</h5><p>Tools to be used are generally classified in different categories, such as auxiliary scanners, vulnerability scanners, exploitation tools and payloads.<br>Initial work is done using an auxiliary scanner such as nmap, which essentially communicates with the target computer and abuses the full capabilities of the TCP/UDP networking protocols to provide us as much information about the target as possible.</p>
<h5 id="Dirbuster"><a href="#Dirbuster" class="headerlink" title="Dirbuster"></a>Dirbuster</h5><p>Another avenue of auxiliary scanning is possible if the target machine is running a web server, as was the case of the Teacher machine. A tool named Dirbuster can be used, which guesses at possible web pages that the server can contain by using a dictionary of a few thousand of the most common web page names (such as index.html, /blog.php, /wordpress etc). Since initially we will have no idea about the structure of a website, we must use a tool like this to identify specific pages of interest. Moodle is an example of a page of interest that would not be found using any other type of tool.</p>
<h5 id="hydra"><a href="#hydra" class="headerlink" title="hydra"></a>hydra</h5><p>Since a primary vulnerability was the user password, we can use tools such as Hydra, which acts like a brute force guesser of passwords given a specific dictionary. This attack involved creating a custom dictionary to launch a guessing attack against a password which was mostly known barring some missing characters.</p>
<h5 id="netcat"><a href="#netcat" class="headerlink" title="netcat"></a>netcat</h5><p>Once we have scanned the target and have identified potential channels of attack, we can then use a tool that will allow our machines to communicate to each other via that open channel. Netcat is an example of that tool, in which we can send commands back to our computer once we have infiltrated remote access on the target server.</p>
<h5 id="reverse-shell"><a href="#reverse-shell" class="headerlink" title="reverse shell"></a>reverse shell</h5><p>The primary workhorse of this attack was the use of a Reverse Shell. A reverse shell is a program which we can execute on the target machine in clever ways in order to allow access to it from our computer. In this scenario, we have exploited Moodle to incorporate a reverse shell into the Moodle server, which lets us connect to it via netcat as mentioned above, and thus begin to take control of the machine.</p>
<h3 id="Recon"><a href="#Recon" class="headerlink" title="Recon"></a>Recon</h3><p>The first step of enumeration is reconnaissance - the art of gathering as much information as we can about the subject.</p>
<p>The very first step I take for recon is run an nmap scan, which will tell us exactly how the target machine appears to the outside world. It’ll tell us about all the channels it’s communicating with, which services it’s sharing with the world and show me potential footholds for attack.</p>
<p>I run this using the command:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">nmap -sV -v -T4 -A &#123;ip address&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>The structure of this command is as follows:</p>
<p><code>-sV</code> - A parameter that lets us view the <strong>V</strong>ersion of any <strong>s</strong>ervices it is running.<br><code>-v</code> - Run in <strong>v</strong>erbose mode, which tells the program to output more information than normal back to us while running, including non critical things like status of the operation, problems etc.</p>
<p><code>-T4</code> - Run the program with <strong>4</strong> <strong>T</strong>hreads. A thread is similar to a lane of traffic of a highway, but for the CPU of the computer. This parameter lets us run the command using 4 lanes of traffic, which can help parallelize and quicken the operation.</p>
<p><code>-A</code> - <strong>A</strong>ttempt to gather information about the OS, including OS name, version, traceroute and potential scripts running</p>
<p>The output of the command may look something similar to this:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-2.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-2.png" alt="Expand Image" title="NMAP"></a>
<p>Straight away we can see that there is an open TCP port at port 80. From experience, I know that this is the port that HTTP traffic communicates on AKA the tangible internet that we can access via a web browser. This means, if we type in <a href="http://10.10.10.153" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://10.10.10.153</a> into a web browser, we should be able to see what that web server is offering us.</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-3.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-3.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Website"></a>
<p>Great - We have a public facing website. We can then use some more reconnaissance tools such as Dirbuster to guess at which else comes after 10.10.10.153/ so we can laterally traverse the website without having any knowledge of it.<br>Dirbuster usually requires a wordlist, which is essentially a large text file containing the most popular variations of page names, and then begins guessing and trying to reach those pages. If it fails, then the web server will simply display a 404 error, which means the requested content was not found. If Dirbuster guesses right, it’ll let us know.</p>
<p>We can use dirbuster in the following way:<br><code>dirb http://10.10.10.153 /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt</code><br>This will use the ‘common’ wordlist, which contains maybe 3000 different variations. If time is not a problem, you could opt for an even larger wordlist.<br>After a few minutes, dirbuster can reveal some interesting information:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-4.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-4.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Moodle"></a>
<p>Dirbuster has found a moodle page, which is something that we would not be able to find via the front page of that website if we looked.<br>Moodle is a piece of software running somewhere on that web server. A piece of software that is likely to have vulnerabilities, which it’s now time to scan.</p>
<h3 id="Vulnerability-Scanning"><a href="#Vulnerability-Scanning" class="headerlink" title="Vulnerability Scanning"></a>Vulnerability Scanning</h3><p>Vulnerability Scanning is essentially a research project on it’s own. There are a few main sources of the information, but Google will be the primary source.<br>Exploit-DB.com is also an excellent source of viewing published vulnerabilities of software and their intended target version. We begin by searching for our potential software flaw using Exploit DB:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-5.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-5.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>There are many avenues of attack we can use, however after reading through each of these exploits they mostly involve getting access to a teacher’s account within moodle. We don’t have an account at all, nor can we create one.</p>
<p>Before we proceed, we need the credentials for a teacher account. We must traverse laterally back to what we have discovered in our enumeration already to see what we missed. At this point, we have only found a website, so we can begin by going back and looking at the website itself.</p>
<p>After a bit of manual trawling through the pages, we can see our first anomaly. This gallery of teachers has a broken picture at the very top left.</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-6.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-6.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>This is a cause of investigation. We can view the source code of the website by pressing the View Source button if we right click anywhere on the page. We are then greeted with this:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-7.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-7.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>images/5 is the only image that has an ‘onerror’ tag within the HTML. This means that possibly someone has purposely made this image invalid in order to provoke that error mesage into the console.<br>If we try and access that image by itself we can see that the browser cannot display it:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-8.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-8.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>I know from experience that if you attempt to open some file that has been renamed an image, or was not originally an image in the first place will cause the browser to give this message. We can then begin forensics of this file to determine what is is.</p>
<p>To begin forensics, we need to download this image, use our Operating System to see if it knows what type of file it is, then view it:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-9.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-9.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>We got the image, used Kali to tell us what it is, then displayed the contents of the supposed text file. We now know that a user named Giovanni has the password Th4C00lTheacha* - with the asterick representing an unknown character.<br>If you refer back to the previous image where we found the Moodle page - we noticed that the Algebra class was taught by a Giovanni. We now have a potential vector for credentials. As a caveat, this is probably the most unrealistic situation in this environment. However, the teacher’s password could be gathered another way in the real world. As an example, the teacher may write down their password on a post-it note or notebook somewhere and simply leave it at their desk. It would be a trivial exercise to ask for a meeting with the teacher at her desk or office, the secretary asking you to wait near that room while she gets the teacher, then performing some physical recon or lockpicking in, having a peek at the password and gaining credentials in that fashion.</p>
<p>This vulnerability is the human one - A password is meant to be kept secure, unique and not easy to be guessed. This is a rule that is broken incredibly often, and is most likely the cause of 99% of security breaches in the world.</p>
<h3 id="Exploitation"><a href="#Exploitation" class="headerlink" title="Exploitation"></a>Exploitation</h3><p>So we have part of a password, and now we need to break in to Giovanni’s account. Since we only have to guess 1 character, we have to map out each possibily of alphanumeric or symbolic characters.</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-10.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-10.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>Here we have created a text file with every variation. We can then feed this to a tool named Hydra, which will guess every single possibility of passwords using those characters we have entered in the wordlist.<br>We can use hydra in the following fashion:</p>
<p><code>hydra -l Giovanni -P /wordlist.txt 10.10.10.153 http-post-form &quot;/moodle/login/index.php:username=^USER^&amp;password=Th4C00lTheacha^PASS^:Invalid login, please try again&quot; -Vv</code></p>
<p>Here is this command broken down:<br><code>-l</code> - <strong>l</strong>ogin as user Giovanni<br><code>-P</code> - use a <strong>P</strong>assword file, the one we made and called it wordlist.txt<br><code>http-post-form</code> - A Post form is essentially just a form that we submit to a website, like a login screen, shopping cart, etc.<br><code>&quot;/moodle/login/index.php&quot;</code> - The location of the actual login page in your browser’s address bar.<br><code>username=^USER^&amp;password=Th4C00lTheacha^PASS^</code> - Use the username we supplied at the beginning, then the password we supplied with the file. Since we know most of it, we can just add the ^PASS^ segment to the end of the line<br><code>:Invalid login, please try again</code> - The message we see on our screen that indicates failure to log in. Hydra needs to know when it has failed.<br><code>-Vv</code> - Enable <strong>V</strong>erbose level 2, this means we want a lot of information to be played back.</p>
<p>After we run this command, we may see some output like the following:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-11.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-11.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>Hydra has announced a success - We now have a password, and can begin exploiting the Moodle software itself, since the methods we researched involved teacher access.</p>
<p>After logging in and prodding around the environment, we stumble across a page that lets us upload custom questions for a Quiz. This is exactly the page we needed, as previous research has indicated that this version of Moodle has a security flaw which allows a teacher to execute code within the custom quiz creation</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-12.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-12.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-13.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-13.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>Since we have done the research, we can exploit this immediately. That web page suggests we enter the following code into the Question field, and then manually adjust the URL at the top of the browser to execute whatever we need it to:</p>
<a href="/media/images/report/huge-14.png"><img src="/media/images/report/body-14.png" alt="Expand Image" title="Expand Image"></a>
<p>We now need a method of creating a reverse shell </p>
